This is a sample text file that we can use to test our token counting utility.
It contains multiple lines of text with various characters and punctuation.

The number of tokens in this file will depend on the tokenization model used.
Some models break text into smaller tokens than others.

You can count the tokens in this file by running:
countgpt example.txt

Or with verbose output:
countgpt -v example.txt
